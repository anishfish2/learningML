# LearningML Repository

Welcome to my **LearningML** repository! This is where I'll be documenting my exciting journey in the world of machine learning and deep learning.

## Introduction

In this repository, I will be sharing my experiences, insights, and progress as I dive deeper into the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence. My goal is to not only consolidate my understanding of concepts I've already studied but also explore new and intriguing topics that pique my interest.

## Current Focus

As of now, my primary focus is on the following:

### 1. Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

I have recently delved into the Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, learning its intricacies and practical applications. You can find my notes, code, and any projects related to this topic in the respective folders within this repository.

### 2. Basic Neural Network Implementation

I am actively working on creating a basic Neural Network from scratch using only the power of NumPy. This project will be a valuable exercise to deepen my understanding of the fundamental principles that underpin neural networks.

## Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the structure of this repository:

- `/NearestNeighbors`: Contains my findings, notes, and code related to the Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

- `/BasicNeuralNetwork`: This directory houses my ongoing project on implementing a basic Neural Network using NumPy. You'll find code, documentation, and any related resources here.

## Future Plans

I am eager to explore a wide range of machine learning and deep learning topics in the near future. Some of the topics I have in mind include:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Reinforcement Learning
- And much more!

Stay tuned for regular updates as I embark on this learning journey. Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or join me in this exciting venture!

Thank you for visiting my LearningML repository, and I hope you find the content here both informative and inspiring. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸš€
